<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The data must be prepared in a certain way before it is uploaded to the Statsomat app: 
Each row represents a record respectively an observation. Each column represents a variable respectively a parameter of interest. Do not store multiple variables in one column (for example sex and age in one column). Apply distinct names for the columns. 
Empty cells indicate missing values. Other values (e.g. "NA" or "9") are not recognized as missing values. Please take a look at these prepared 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://statsomat.shinyapps.io/datasets/"><b>dataset examples</b></a>, they can help you with the data preparation.</p>
<p>Once you have your data prepared in the specified way, please save it with the text CSV format. If your data file is in an Excel or LibreOffice format, you can try to convert it to CSV by selecting "Save As".
Try to select the format CSV with the character encoding UFT-8, this helps reading the data correctly. You can also prepare or inspect the CSV file with a text editor like 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"><b>Notepad++</b></a>.</p> 
<p>When your data is ready, you can proceed with the upload. A couple of upload properties must be specified. If you are not sure about them, you can choose the option "Auto" for each property. In that case, the 
Statsomat app will try to identify automatically the right settings. In most of the cases, this will succeed. Otherwise, please consider alternative settings or data formats.</p>   
<p>After a successful upload of the data, you can proceed with the selection of the variables which should be considered by this app.</p>  
<p>Now you can generate and download the report. To make use of the table of contents, please open the report with a PDF reader (for example Adobe Acrobat Reader).</p> 
<p>To abort the computations, please disconnect the app by pressing the button in the upper right corner of the screen and reload the app. </p>
